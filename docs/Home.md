**Project Description**
A C# project to simulate and test a multiagent algorithm for finding multiple noisy radiation sources with spatial and communication constraints with an emulated environment.


The algorithm tries to detect the source(s) of radiation with some robots in the monitoring fields. Each robot has a sensor mounted to detect the radiation concentration. The robots cooperate and communicate with each other to locate the sources based on the sensors readings using concepts from particle swarm optimization algorithm.
